# Advent of Code 2022 - Learning Go

This is my first time working through the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
and I'm starting with the most recent problem set at the time of writing; the
[2022 event](https://adventofcode.com/2022). I'm using this primarily as a way
to learn the [Go programming language](https://go.dev/). Key word here being
**learn**; do not go into this repository expecting the most elegant and
performant go code you've ever seen!
